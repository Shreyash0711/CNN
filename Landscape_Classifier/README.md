# Landscape Classifier 🌄

A deep learning-based image classification project to identify different types of landscapes such as mountains, forests, deserts, beaches, and more.

## 📝 Project Description
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of various landscapes into predefined categories. The model is trained and evaluated using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Files
- `Landscape_Classifier.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the entire code pipeline for preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and testing.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Image input resized to (224x224x3)
- **Convolution Layers**: Multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers
- **Flattening Layer**
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
